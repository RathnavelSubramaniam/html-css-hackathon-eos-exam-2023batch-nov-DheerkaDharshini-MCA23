    <h1>My National Prayer</h1> <br>
    <p>The grand Scene of birth of Independent India In that mid-night, the flag of the ruler of two centuries lowered, The tri-color Indian flag flaps in the Red Fort in the midst of National Anthem. The first vision of Independent India was dawned. <br><br>

        The rejoice everywhere, happiness all around, There was a tender cry: where is the father of the nation? The white clothed soul walking in the midst of sorrows and pain, Injected by hatred and ego, the result of communal violence. <br><br>
        
        The father of the nation, Mahatma, walking bare footed In the streets of Bengal for peace and harmony With the strength of blessed soul of Mahatma I pray the Almighty: When will be the dawn of second vision? <br><br>
        
        Create thoughts in the minds of my people, And transform those thoughts into action. Embed the thought of Nation being bigger than The individual, in the minds of leaders and people. <br><br>
        
        Help all the leaders of my country to give strength And bless the nation with peace and prosperity. Give strength to all my religious leaders to bring 'Unity of Minds' among all our billion people. <br><br>
        
        Oh Almighty, bless all my people to work and transform Our country from a developing into a developed nation. Let this second vision be born out of sweat of my people, And bless our youth to live in Developed India.</p>
    <br><br>
        <h1>Song of Youth</h1> <br>
    <p>As a young citizen of India, armed with technology, knowledge and love for my nation, I realize, small aim is a crime. <br><br>

        I will work and sweat for a great vision, the vision of transforming India into a developed nation, powered by economic strength with value system<br><br>
        
        I am one of the citizens of the billion; Only the vision will ignite the billion souls.<br><br>
        
        It has entered into me ; The ignited soul compared to any resource is the most powerful resource on the earth, above the earth and under the earth.<br><br>
        
        I will keep the lamp of knowledge burning to achieve the vision - Developed India<br><br>
        
        If we work and sweat for the great vision with ignited minds, the transformation leading to the birth of vibrant developed India will happen.<br><br>
        
        I pray the Almighty: "May the divine peace with beauty enter into our people; Happiness and good health blossom in our bodies, minds and souls".</p>
